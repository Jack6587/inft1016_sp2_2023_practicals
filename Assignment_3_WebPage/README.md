# Important Information and Synopsis

This website is designed to display information covered in Assignments 1 and 2 for Information Technology Fundamentals. This website utilises .html, CSS and JavaScript code.

## How to install and run
To operate this website, the user must download the "base.css" file so that the "WebPage.html" file can operate correctly. The CSS file is responsible for the display colours and the "dark" or "light" display themes that the user can switch between. This is done through two colour palettes: ":root" and "[data-theme="dark"]", which refer to the same colour name values, but with different properties (e.g. primary-color = rgb(255, 255, 255) in ":root" and rgb(0, 0, 0) in the "dark" theme. 

The JavaScript found in the .html file is responsible for the actual function of the toggle switch. It adjusts the value of the switch, setting the value of "data-theme".
