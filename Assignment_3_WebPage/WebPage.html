  <p>Mobile application development is the process of creating software applications that run on a mobile device, such as a phone or a tablet. This application would typically require a network connection to operate with the correct resources. This job involves the use of code, binaries and assets as well as application testing on the targeted devices. </p>

        <h2>Mobile applications development as a career</h2>        
        <p>Mobile applications development had a growth rate of 9.6% from 2016 to 2021. In the year 2021, there were 1,006 job postings. The average market salary for new hires is $120,000 and the most common job titles in this occupation are known as “Android Developer”, “Senior Android Developer”, and “Mobile Developer”.</p>
        
        <h3>Development process</h3>
        <p>Programming languages typically used include Java, C#, Swift and HTML5. iOS and Android operating systems are the most common platforms for applications to run on. It costs on average $150,000 - $200,000 to develop a mobile application, and generally takes four to six months to create.</p> 
        <p>There are two approaches for application development when targeting different operating systems. One way is to develop a “native” application. The benefit of this is that individual application programming interfaces (APIs) and specific programming languages can be used to create a more powerful and optimised program. Native application development is particularly beneficial on Android, as it is easier to create a minimum viable product (MVP) there and then convert, debug and optimise it for iOS later. This means any software can be released sooner to a larger audience. This is a key strategy for many independent developers. Hybrid application development uses a single codebase to function on both operating systems. This is usually something universally recognised, such as Java/JavaScript or HTML. Hybrid development typically works best for simplistic three to four page web applications, as this method does not provide the native application programming interfaces.</p>
        
        <h3>Security risks and concerns</h3>
        
        <p>The development of mobile applications has grown greatly in recent years. With the increase in experience among developers, the knowledge around how people use and develop for mobile devices has increased. Despite this increase in knowledge, there are still considerations surrounding security in both the user experience and the development process. These are known as human and technical factors respectively. While the distribution environments (such as the OS) that are provided by Google and Apple are closed environments that are typically safe, there is still some exposure to the user experience that puts their security at risk. One primary threat is click-fraudulent advertising that appears in applications (Weichbroth & Łysik 2020). This usually comes from free applications that are supported by advertisements. Advertisement libraries from the app take content from ad providers that display on the user interface of an app. This ad provider pays the app developer for displaying ad content and for clicks. Advertisement fraud occurs when ads are “fetched” without being displayed or are automatically clicked on (Crussell, Stevens & Chen 2014). Another threat to users in mobile applications is phishing (fraudulent practice that typically mimics reputable companies to steal passwords or credit card numbers, for example) in apps. This is an emerging threat as it has been found that many “phishing” apps do not necessarily contain any malicious data, but rather that they are a browser window to actual phishing sites, meaning it works in cooperation with the actual phishing website (Weichbroth & Łysik 2020). A final important point of consideration for mobile users is malware. As smart mobile phones approach the technical capabilities of personal computers, there are also increasing malware threats on this platform. Some notable malware includes Android GMBot, a spyware that exists on third-party app stores that steals user information, AceDeceiver iOS, which works to steal user Apple ID, and Marcher Android malware, which pretends to be a bank website in order to trick users into inputting login credentials (Weichbroth & Łysik 2020). Security risks in mobile applications are growing as the technology expands. Mobile users should be aware of the security problems that could come with owning a smartphone, and be made conscious of how to avoid these problems (such as to avoid clicking on advertisements or links).</p>
        
        <h3>Implementation and Optimisation</h3>
        The implementation of mobile applications is seen across many fields. One area that it could provide crucial support to is in large and small businesses. Mobile devices alone can provide convenience and efficiency to business output. The key advantages of using mobile applications in a business are agility (being able to conduct business at any place, any time), flexibility (conducting business while travelling or participating in other activities) and broadcasting (being able to produce and provide current data to many people) (Nah, Siau & Sheng 2005). UPS is a company that enhances the user experience through a mobile application that allows for package delivery tracking and verification (Nah, Siau & Sheng 2005). Commonwealth Bank allows users to engage in banking services on a mobile device. IKEA uses “IKEA Place” which lets customers display products in their own home through augmented reality (Nitecki, S. 2023). The common element these companies share is in user satisfaction. It focuses on simplicity, convenience, and necessity. Some focuses for businesses to properly enhance the user experience are: increasing connectivity and responsiveness for customers, maximising integration with operating systems and existing databases, and focusing on accuracy and minimisation of errors (Nah, Siau & Sheng 2005). A key consideration for the implementation of mobile applications is perceptions from customers and providers. This is a previously mentioned factor in this report as a limiter/barrier to successful optimisation in different industries. Research from (Miller et al. 2019) looked into mobile applications for mental health monitoring and access to self-management tools. The element that was measured as highly important was the providers’ (mental health support providers) perception of these apps, which is critical to sufficient implementation. 80% of providers surveyed in this study said that they believed in or used mobile applications with their patients. These patients generally had a positive perception and found comfort in using them. The common barriers here are being unfamiliar with this technology and its use in this field, and patients not owning smartphones.
