  <p>Mobile application development is the process of creating software applications that run on a mobile device, such as a phone or a tablet. This application would typically require a network connection to operate with the correct resources. This job involves the use of code, binaries and assets as well as application testing on the targeted devices. </p>

        <h2>Mobile applications development as a career</h2>        
        <p>Mobile applications development had a growth rate of 9.6% from 2016 to 2021. In the year 2021, there were 1,006 job postings. The average market salary for new hires is $120,000 and the most common job titles in this occupation are known as “Android Developer”, “Senior Android Developer”, and “Mobile Developer”.</p>
        
        <h3>Development process</h3>
        <p>Programming languages typically used include Java, C#, Swift and HTML5. iOS and Android operating systems are the most common platforms for applications to run on. It costs on average $150,000 - $200,000 to develop a mobile application, and generally takes four to six months to create.</p> 
        <p>There are two approaches for application development when targeting different operating systems. One way is to develop a “native” application. The benefit of this is that individual application programming interfaces (APIs) and specific programming languages can be used to create a more powerful and optimised program. Native application development is particularly beneficial on Android, as it is easier to create a minimum viable product (MVP) there and then convert, debug and optimise it for iOS later. This means any software can be released sooner to a larger audience. This is a key strategy for many independent developers. Hybrid application development uses a single codebase to function on both operating systems. This is usually something universally recognised, such as Java/JavaScript or HTML. Hybrid development typically works best for simplistic three to four page web applications, as this method does not provide the native application programming interfaces.</p>
